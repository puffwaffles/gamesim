A simple website that simulates a gacha game

Current Features:
* Allows for different user accounts with a maximum of 5 save files allocated for each user. Users can sign up and login to their own accounts. Users can also logout and delete their accounts
* An information guide that appears before a user starts and can be skipped. This guide can be reaccessed after the user logs in.
* A save button that allows users to save their progress at any point to their current save file.
* An inventory system to store characters. Characters can be released for rewards and inventory space can be increased to accomodate more characters.
* A summoning system that allows users to summon new characters. So far only the 1-3 star Fire/Water/Wood batch summons have been implemented.
* A shop that allows you to buy more coins and jewels. These currency are needed to summon, purchase items, and perform other activities.
* A roster that keeps track of how many characters you have acquired and whether you have claimed rewards for them. Users can earn jewels for getting new characters.

Features/Things to be added later:
* More characters to be added to the roster. Currently there are only characters for 1-3 star rarities for Fire, Water, and Wood. I first plan on adding 4-5 star characters for Fire, Water, and Wood before adding Light and Dark characters.
* More summon options. After I implement more characters, I can increase the number of summon varieties.
* A battle system. I planning on adding stats (Hp, atk, def) and a special skill for each character so they can battle each other. I will first add a single character battle system before adding a multi character team battle system.
* A leveling system. Currently there the character is capped at level 1. I would like to implement a system that will allow characters to gain exp to increase their level and allow them to access more tasks.
* A missions system. This will reward the user with exp and currency/items for performing specific tasks (i.e. accumulating a certain amount of characters or performing a certain amount of battles). 
* A mechanism that allows you to view a character from the roster.

Features/Things I would like to add later (but might not be added):
* A leveling and item equipment system to increase the strength of characters.
* A way to pick which save file to save to. Currently you can only save to the save file you are currently on.
* An autosave function that can be turned on/off. This will allow users to let the system save for them instead of having to manually save with the save button. Users can choose to autosave after each action or save after logging out. 
* Packages for summon vouchers that can be bought from the shop.
* A login bonus system.
* An inbox system.
* More characters per each type and rarity
* A way for users to mark which characters they would like to avoid being released (or sacrificed if implemented) and a way to unmark them.
* A special summon that allows users to pick a certain number of characters to be used to acquire special/chosen characters.
* Images to depict currency and types. Perhaps visual indicators in summons to indicate when more rare characters have been summoned.
* Coloring and animations to character sprites. This will take quite a while, so I would like to get the other features put in first.
